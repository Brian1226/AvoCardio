### Problem Statement
Many people aren't maintaining a healthy diet and participating in regular exercises, which can deteriorate their wellbeing. Some challenges that prevent people from tracking their dietary and fitness habits include lack of awareness of the nutritional content in the food being consumed, failure to create a structured meal plan or workout plan, discouragement from using unintuitive applications or relying on pen-and-paper methods (which can be easily forgotten), boredom due to limited variety in recipes and workouts, and the negligence of tracking calorie intake. In the current market, there are applications that focus on recipes or ones that focus on workouts, but rarely both. In addition, these applications' features may be complicated to use, their user interface may be bloated and not user-friendly, and they may cost money.

### Solution
AvoCardio is an user-friendly, all-in-one resource for everyone to use in order to improve their wellbeing. This web application simplified the process of searching for detailed recipes, generating personalized meal plans, creating shopping lists, and tracking calories burned from workouts.
